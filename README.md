# Math Problems
This repository contains solved math problems in Jupyter Notebook form. This is something that I am currently experimenting with. I am not sure if I will continue to practice math this way in the future. Currently, I see it as a good way to practice math, latex and coding at the same time.

## Current issue.
 * The newline `\\` character for mathjax is not currently rendering properly on Github. I am unsure if there is a fix planned for this in the future or not.
